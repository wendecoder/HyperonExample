# Example usage:

# Query existing knowledge of capabilities
# query_capability("uAgent") # Output = [microservice, message_handling, event_processing, REST_endpoints]

# # Now let's add new capability knowledge
# add_knowledge("capability", "uAgent", "new_capability")

# Assume now your server went down and up again, if you haven't written to file, you would lose the new knowledge, but since you wrote to file, just by loading the file again(which is done in the above methods in `query_str`) you will have the new knowledge available.
query_capability("uAgent") # Output = [microservice, message_handling, event_processing, REST_endpoints, new_capability]

# The same can be done for communication patterns
# query_communication("ctx.send") # Output = [asynchronous, fire_and_forget]
# add_knowledge("communication", "ctx.send", "new_pattern")
# query_communication("ctx.send") # Output = [asynchronous, fire_and_forget, new_pattern]
